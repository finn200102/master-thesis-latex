  abstract = {Particle accelerators are complex facilities that produce large
              amounts of structured data and have clear optimization goals as
              well as precisely defined control requirements. As such they are
              naturally amenable to data-driven research methodologies. The data
              from sensors and monitors inside the accelerator form multivariate
              time series. With fast pre-emptive approaches being highly
              preferred in accelerator control and diagnostics, the application
              of data-driven time series forecasting methods is particularly
              promising. This review formulates the time series forecasting
              problem and summarizes existing models with applications in various
              scientific areas. Several current and future attempts in the field
              of particle accelerators are introduced. The application of time
              series forecasting to particle accelerators has shown encouraging
              results and the promise for broader use, and existing problems such
              as data consistency and compatibility have started to be addressed.

              geometry, the onset of corona precedes the development of a spark.
              However, in weakly nonuniform fields, corona is unable to form
              before it transitions into a spark. The degree of nonuniformity at
              which this transition occurs is known as the corona point.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the streamer-to-spark transition in a
              self-pulsing dc-driven discharge called a transient spark (TS). The
              TS is a streamer-to-spark transition discharge with short spark
              duration (∼10–100 ns), based on charging and discharging of the
              internal capacity of the electric circuit with repetition frequency
              1–10 kHz. The TS can be maintained under relatively low energy
              conditions (0.1–1 mJ pulse−1). It generates a very reactive
              non-equilibrium air plasma applicable for ﬂue gas cleaning or
              bio-decontamination. Thanks to the short spark current pulse
              duration, the steady-state gas temperature, measured at the
              beginning of the streamers initiating the TS, increases from an
              initial value of ∼300 K only up to ∼550 K at 10 kHz. The
              streamer-to-spark transition is governed by the subsequent increase
              in the gas temperature in the plasma channel up to ∼1000 K. This
              breakdown temperature does not change with increasing repetition
              frequency f . The heating after the streamer accelerates with
              increasing f , leading to a decrease in the average
              streamer-to-spark transition time from a few µs to less than 100
              ns.},

              generator of about 1 MV in an air gap of 1 up to 1.5 meter, at
              standard temperature and pressure. We show the evolution of the
              discharge with nanosecond-fast photography together with the
              electrical characteristics. The negative discharge develops through
              four well-distinguished streamer bursts. The streamers have
              different velocities and life times in different bursts. The last
              burst triggers a positive inception cloud on the positive grounded
              electrode and a burst of positive counter-streamers emerges. The
              pre-discharge then bridges the gap and leaders grow from both
              electrodes. Finally a spark is formed. Looking closer into the
              pre-ionized zone near the cathode, we find isolated dots which are
              potential branching points. These dots act as starting points for
              positive streamers that move towards the high-voltage electrode. We
              also find such phenomena as space leaders and leader stepping in
              our laboratory sparks.},

  abstract = {Fundamental processes for electric breakdown, i.e., electrode
              emission and bulk ionization, as well as the resultant Paschen's
              law, are reviewed under various conditions. The effect of the
              ramping rate of applied voltage on breakdown is first introduced
              for macroscopic gaps, followed by showing the significant impact of
              the electric field nonuniformity due to gap geometry. The classical
              Paschen's law assumes uniform electric field; a more general
              breakdown scaling law is illustrated for both DC and RF fields in
              geometrically similar gaps, based on the Townsend similarity
              theory. For a submillimeter gap, effects of electrode surface
              morphology with local field enhancement and electric shielding on
              the breakdown curve are discussed, including the most recent
              efforts. Breakdown characteristics and scaling laws in microgaps
              with both metallic and non-metallic (e.g., semiconductor) materials
              are detailed. For gap distance down to micro/nano scales, the
              breakdown characteristics and the breakdown mode transition from
              the secondary electron emission to the electric field emission or
              thermionic emission dominant regime. Additionally, the combined
              thermo-field emission regime is also reviewed. Previous efforts,
              including key simulations and experiments, have been devoted to
              diagnosing breakdown path evolution, measuring breakdown fields,
              and quantifying breakdown dependence on frequencies for gaps down
              to micro/nano scales. By summarizing and analyzing fundamental
              theories, recent progress, and on-going challenges, this tutorial
              review seeks to provide basic understanding and the state of the
              art of electric breakdown, which aids in advancing discoveries and
              promoting application prospects for discharge devices engineered in
